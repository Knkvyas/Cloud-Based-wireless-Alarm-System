Step to configure bluetooth module


For Slave Configuration
1)During power supply first reset the module before uploading code.
2) Upload blank code(create new file) in first bluetooth module.
3) After successful upload in Arduino, Open Serial Monitor and type Below Commands
	AT (Enter)
Output- OK
	AT+ROLE? (Enter)  Tells whether it is Slave(Role-0) or Master(Role-1)
OUTPUT- if '0' then we need address of slave type AT+ADDR? (Enter)
		Copy the address in notepad and change those (:) to (,)



For master Module we need to do
1) Change role to Master
2) Change connection mode
3) Bind to slave module

Repeat from step 1- step3 
Default Bluetooth moduel is set to slave (ROLE-0)
we need to make Role - 1

So Type AT+ROLE=1 
OUTPUT - OK    To conform type AT+ROLE? output - 1 (master is set)

Now to check connection mode 
AT+CMODE?
if CMODE :0 (Connected to one)  we want this
if CMODE :1 (Connected to any)

SO type AT+CMODE=0    
After this we need to give address to connect to so type AT+BIND=[put address here]
enter
To conform AT+BIND?
