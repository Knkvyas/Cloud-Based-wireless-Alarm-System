For wire configuration 
Make some changes for Both Modules i.e
1) Connect Rx of Arduino to Tx of Bluetooth Module
2) Connect Tx of Arduino to Rx of Bluetooth Module

To check if both of them are connected check the synchronous blink between them.

After this pairing is done, Now to upload original code in module
1) Connect Rx to Rx and Tx to Tx (Bluetooth moduel to Arduino) 
2) during power supply press Reset Button of Bluetooth module
3) Upload Code in Adruino
4) After Successful Upload 
	Make some changes for Both Modules i.e
	i) Connect Rx of Arduino to Tx of Bluetooth Module
	ii) Connect Tx of Arduino to Rx of Bluetooth Module
5) Now check the synchronous blink between them.
6) Bluetooth Modules are connected.
